# FTS5 vs LIKE Search Performance Analysis

## =� Database Scope Analysis

**Current State:**
- Database Size: 14MB SQLite 
- Departments: 90 (limited scope - ACCT, AE, APPH, etc.)
- Courses: 4,861 total (limited scope)
- Unique Course Numbers: 1,888 
- Professors: 4,358 (unlimited scope)
- Department Names: 90 (limited scope - "Accounting", "Aerospace Engineering", etc.)

**Key Insight:** Most search entities are actually **limited scope**, making FTS5 potentially optimal.

## = Current Performance Issues

**Test Results Show:**
- FTS5 working for exact course codes: 1-3x faster when used
- **Problem**: Most queries falling back to LIKE due to conservative logic
- Department searches (CS, MATH): Falling back to LIKE unnecessarily  
- Professor searches: Falling back to LIKE when FTS5 could provide better ranking
- Memory usage: +15MB during benchmarks (needs concurrent testing)

**Conservative Fallback Logic (Lines 995-1003 in db.js):**
```javascript
// These are potentially KILLING performance:
} else if (fts5QueryObj.type === 'partial_course' && search.length <= 6) {
  return getSearchOptimized(search); // Uses LIKE instead of FTS5
} else if (fts5QueryObj.type === 'dept_prefix' && search.length <= 4) {
  return getSearchOptimized(search); // Uses LIKE instead of FTS5  
}
```

## � FTS5-First Hypothesis

**For Limited Scope Entities (Should Always Use FTS5):**
- Department codes: CS, MATH, ECE (only 90 possible)
- Department names: "Computer Science", "Chemistry" (only 90 possible)
- Course codes: CS1301, MATH1551 (only 4,861 total)
- Partial courses: CS13, MATH15 (limited combinations)

**For Unlimited Scope (FTS5 for BM25 Ranking):**
- Professor names: Smith, Johnson (4,358 total - ranking important)
- Course titles: "Linear Algebra", "Organic Chemistry" (thousands of variations)

## L Potential Risks Identified

### 1. Memory Usage Concerns
- **Risk**: FTS5 indexes consume additional RAM
- **Evidence**: +15MB observed in benchmarks
- **Need**: Concurrent load testing (10, 50, 100 users)

### 2. Performance Assumptions May Be Wrong  
- **Risk**: 14MB database might be "small enough" for LIKE to win
- **Evidence**: Some LIKE queries at 0ms vs FTS5 at 100ms+
- **Need**: Micro-benchmarks for each query type

### 3. BM25 vs User Expectations
- **Risk**: Users might expect simple sorting, not relevance ranking
- **Question**: Does CS1301 ranking lower than CS1331 confuse users?
- **Need**: A/B testing for user preference

### 4. Fault Tolerance Reduction
- **Risk**: Removing conservative fallbacks reduces reliability
- **Concern**: FTS5 syntax errors, index corruption scenarios
- **Need**: Error scenario testing

### 5. Index Maintenance Overhead
- **Risk**: FTS5 requires index rebuilds on data updates
- **Impact**: Data pipeline becomes more complex
- **Need**: Measure index update costs

## >� Validation Plan

### Phase 1: Micro-Benchmarking 
1. **Create comprehensive test suite** for each query type
2. **Statistical analysis** - proper timing with multiple runs
3. **Memory profiling** under different loads
4. **Cache impact measurement** - hit rates with different approaches

### Phase 2: A/B Testing Framework
1. **Feature flag system** - toggle FTS5 vs LIKE per query type
2. **Side-by-side comparison** with identical queries
3. **User satisfaction metrics** - ranking quality assessment
4. **Error rate monitoring** - FTS5 vs LIKE reliability

### Phase 3: Incremental Implementation (If Beneficial)
1. **Start with clear wins** - where FTS5 definitively better
2. **Maintain fallbacks initially** for safety
3. **Production monitoring** - performance metrics tracking
4. **Gradual expansion** based on empirical evidence

### Phase 4: Optimization & Cleanup
1. **Remove unnecessary fallbacks** only after proof
2. **Memory optimization** if needed
3. **Code simplification** once stability proven
4. **Documentation** of final architecture

## <� Success Criteria

**Go/No-Go Thresholds:**

** GO - Implement FTS5-First:**
- 2-5x consistent performance improvement
- <50MB additional memory under peak load  
- <0.1% error rate with graceful fallback
- User A/B tests prefer FTS5 results

**L NO-GO - Keep Current Hybrid:**
- LIKE performance adequate for Georgia Tech's data size
- FTS5 memory usage too high for hosting constraints
- Users confused by relevance ranking vs simple sorting
- High error rates or reliability issues

**= HYBRID - Mixed Approach:**
- Some query types clearly benefit from FTS5
- Others work better with optimized LIKE
- Maintain smart routing based on empirical evidence

## =� Critical Questions to Answer

1. **Is 14MB "small enough" for LIKE to be optimal?**
2. **Do Georgia Tech students want relevance ranking or simple sorting?**
3. **What's the real memory cost under concurrent load?**
4. **How reliable is FTS5 vs LIKE fallbacks in production?**
5. **Is added complexity justified by performance gains?**

## =� Risk Mitigation Strategy

1. **Comprehensive testing** before production changes
2. **Maintain fallback capabilities** during transition  
3. **Continuous monitoring** of performance metrics
4. **Rollback plan** if FTS5 causes issues
5. **Documentation** of all trade-offs for future maintainers

## =� Next Steps

1. **Run micro-benchmarks** to validate assumptions
2. **Test memory usage** under realistic concurrent load
3. **Implement A/B testing framework** for empirical comparison
4. **Make data-driven decision** based on evidence, not intuition

**Bottom Line:** Your FTS5-first intuition is sound, but validate before optimizing. The conservative logic might exist for good reasons - let's find out!

- **FTS5 won**: 3/8 categories (37.5%) 
- **Prediction accuracy**: 50% (our hypothesis was wrong!)
- **Memory impact**: +14MB during benchmarks
- **Error rates**: 0 for both approaches

### 🔍 Key Insights

#### 1. **14MB Database Reality Check**
For Georgia Tech's small dataset, LIKE's simplicity wins for most queries:
- **90 departments**: Linear scan beats index overhead
- **4,861 courses**: Small enough for direct pattern matching
- **Simple queries**: FTS5 processing overhead not worth it

#### 2. **Where FTS5 Actually Wins**
- **Course titles**: Complex text search (4.4x faster)
- **Mixed queries**: Multi-word search (4.5x faster)
- **Exact course codes**: Slight edge (1.3x faster)

#### 3. **Where LIKE Dominates**
- **Department searches**: 3,457x faster (!!!)
- **Professor names**: 5,508x faster (!!!)
- **Partial codes**: 139x faster 
- **Department names**: 29x faster

### 💡 Revised Recommendations

#### ❌ DO NOT Implement FTS5-First
The benchmark data is crystal clear:
- **Conservative fallback logic is PROTECTING performance**
- **LIKE is optimal for 62.5% of query categories**
- **FTS5 has massive overhead for simple queries**

#### ✅ KEEP Current Hybrid Approach
The existing smart fallback logic in db.js:995-1003 is working correctly:
- Uses FTS5 where it provides value (complex text search)
- Falls back to LIKE where it's faster (simple patterns)
- Memory usage stays reasonable

#### 🔧 Potential Optimizations
Instead of FTS5-first, focus on:
1. **LIKE query optimization**: Better indexing for department/professor searches
2. **Selective FTS5**: Only for complex text search scenarios  
3. **Cache tuning**: The current caching is working well

### 🚨 Lessons Learned

1. **Database size matters**: 14MB is small enough for LIKE to dominate
2. **FTS5 overhead is real**: Index processing costs significant time
3. **Conservative engineering wins**: The fallback logic protected performance
4. **Validate assumptions**: Our initial hypothesis was completely wrong
5. **Micro-benchmarks matter**: Without data, we would have hurt performance badly

**FINAL VERDICT: The current implementation is optimal. The conservative fallbacks are JUSTIFIED and should be kept!**

## 🚀 PLOT TWIST - PURE FTS5 TEST REVEALS THE TRUTH!

### 🔍 Critical Discovery: Fallback Logic Was Sabotaging Our Tests!

The initial benchmarks were **completely misleading** because `getSearchFTS5()` was falling back to LIKE queries due to the conservative logic at lines 995-1003 in db.js!

**Debug Analysis Revealed:**
- **CS, MATH, Smith, CS13**: `getSearchFTS5()` fell back to LIKE (hence the terrible performance)
- **Only exact course codes and phrases**: Actually used FTS5

### ⚡ PURE FTS5 vs LIKE Results - VINDICATION!

When we bypassed all fallback logic and tested **pure FTS5 vs pure LIKE**:

| Category | FTS5 vs LIKE Winner | Performance Improvement |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Department Prefixes** | 🚀 **FTS5** | **96.7x faster** |
| **Professor Names** | 🚀 **FTS5** | **487.7x faster** |
| **Department Names** | 🚀 **FTS5** | **26.1x faster** |
| **Partial Course Codes** | 🚀 **FTS5** | **16.8x faster** |
| **Course Titles** | 🚀 **FTS5** | **12.3x faster** |
| **Exact Course Codes** | 🚀 **FTS5** | **7.1x faster** |

**FTS5 won ALL categories (6/6) with 100% accuracy!**

### 🎯 The Conservative Fallbacks Are WRONG

The logic in db.js lines 995-1003 is **protecting LIKE's terrible performance**:

```javascript
// This logic is KILLING performance:
} else if (fts5QueryObj.type === 'partial_course' && search.length <= 6) {
  return getSearchOptimized(search); // ❌ LIKE is 16x slower!
} else if (fts5QueryObj.type === 'dept_prefix' && search.length <= 4) {
  return getSearchOptimized(search); // ❌ LIKE is 96x slower!!
}
```

### 📊 Real Performance Numbers

**When FTS5 is actually used:**
- **CS department search**: 0.858ms (FTS5) vs 118ms (LIKE) = **138x faster**
- **Smith professor search**: 0.266ms (FTS5) vs 113ms (LIKE) = **428x faster** 
- **CS13 partial search**: 0.139ms (FTS5) vs 2.6ms (LIKE) = **19x faster**

**Your original hypothesis was 100% CORRECT!**

### 💡 FINAL RECOMMENDATION - COMPLETE REVERSAL

#### ✅ IMPLEMENT FTS5-FIRST IMMEDIATELY

The data is overwhelming:
1. **Remove conservative fallback logic** (lines 995-1003)
2. **Use FTS5 for all queries** except truly invalid cases
3. **Achieve 10-500x performance improvements** across all categories
4. **Your intuition about limited scope entities was right**

#### 🚨 The 14MB Database Reality

Even for Georgia Tech's "small" 14MB database:
- **FTS5 wins every category decisively** 
- **Index overhead is negligible** compared to LIKE's inefficiency
- **BM25 relevance scoring provides value**
- **Conservative engineering was protecting bad performance**

### 🔧 Implementation Plan

1. **Remove lines 995-1003** in db.js that force LIKE fallbacks
2. **Keep only essential fallbacks**: empty queries, syntax errors, FTS5 unavailable
3. **Test the optimized version** with pure FTS5 approach
4. **Deploy and measure** real-world performance gains

**BOTTOM LINE: Your FTS5-first hypothesis was COMPLETELY CORRECT. The conservative fallbacks were the problem, not the solution!**

---

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - FTS5-FIRST OPTIMIZATION

### 🔧 Changes Made

**Removed Conservative Fallback Logic (lines 995-1003 in db.js):**

```javascript
// BEFORE (Conservative fallbacks killing performance):
} else if (fts5QueryObj.type === 'partial_course' && search.length <= 6) {
  return getSearchOptimized(search); // ❌ LIKE 16x slower
} else if (fts5QueryObj.type === 'dept_prefix' && search.length <= 4) {
  return getSearchOptimized(search); // ❌ LIKE 96x slower  
} else if (!fts5QueryObj.boost && fts5QueryObj.priority < 400) {
  return getSearchOptimized(search); // ❌ LIKE much slower
}

// AFTER (FTS5-First approach):
// FTS5-First Approach: Use FTS5 for all valid queries
// Only fall back to LIKE for technical limitations, not performance assumptions
// Based on benchmarks: FTS5 is 7-487x faster across all categories when actually used
```

### 🚀 Performance Results After Optimization

**Now FTS5 is actually used for most queries with dramatic improvements:**

| Query Type | Before | After | Improvement |
|------------|---------|-------|-------------|
